Problem-solving is my natural state. I’m never happier than when I have a fresh challenge to tackle.

### <a name="projects">Projects & Code</a>
Two projects out of many completed during makers that I particularly enjoyed contributing to.
#### AtomicWars
A plugin for Atom that Interfaces with the CodeWars.com API to pull down kata for you to solve and displays them in Atom so you can complete them in your preferred environment. This app also uploads your completed kata up to GitHub when you’ve submitted them.
#### Thunder Warriors
A tower defence game built in unity. While the main goal of undertaking the project was to familiarise myself with C# development, we ended up learning a lot more about code debt and refactoring. Halfway through we decided we’d rather start almost from scratch rather than keep the patterns we’d used while trying to get something working. It ended up being my favourite project during makers by far and I hope to develop what we have created further as time goes on.

### <a name="Education">Education</a>
#### Makers Academy
Built upon my foundation of learning by studying new concepts like TDD, SOLID, MVC and more. Changed my patterns of thinking about programming to result in much neater code than at the beginning.
#### 2 years at Bradford University
Studied Cybernetics and virtual worlds - this included subjects like Human interface design, Robotics and Programming.
