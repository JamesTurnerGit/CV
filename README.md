### LexisNexis-Enterprise Solutions
#### Software Engineer Apr 2018 — present
Worked with a team on developing a progressive web app that runs off a micro-services based back-end that integrates with Microsoft Dynamics 365. The app synchronises across multiple devices and runs on any modern device and is offline-first. Made significant contributions to the front and back-end of the app. Was involved heavily in the design process.

Helped run and organise a block-chain hackathon. Was involved from the very initial planning stages to the late night cleanup. Event concluded very successfully and was a lot of fun.

Mentored a new starter to take on previous role and later into a further role as another Software Engineer. Mentored other employees on starting their own dynamic web projects until they were able to progress the project by themselves.

Helped two teams transition from a scrum methodology to a Kanban approach.
#### QA Engineer Oct 2017 — Apr 2018 
Wrote several testing packages from scratch, including one that was able to do front-end and interaction testing on Power BI, and another that was able to parse report outputs in a convenient and straightforward way.

Worked on the testing project for the main product, renovating and refactoring large sections and improving performance and ease of use while driving upskilling for the QA team.

Ran full scale regression testing on the company's main product before major releases and wrote up documentation and procedures surrounding it.

### Makers Academy 2017
Built upon my foundation of self-taught learning by studying new concepts like TDD, SOLID, MVC and more. This changed my patterns of thinking about programming to result in writing much neater code than before I started.

### NM group Oct 2012- Dec 2016 

Responsible for processing large point clouds gathered from LiDAR scanners into accurate computer simulations of overhead power-lines and other utilities. During my time here my love for coding and puzzle solving was reignited. 

Fixed a systematic issue with a massive ground model with a custom script. saved several thousand pounds in man-hours alone. Decided to go into programming as a career because this event was so fufilling.

Solved a lot of additional problems in production by continuing to write scripts in Python and MicroStation Basic.

Worked effectively on a small team which hit deadlines consistently.

### Thunder Warriors - [Web Demo](http://thunder-warriors.herokuapp.com/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/treborb/thunder-warriors)
A tower defence game built in Unity. While the main goal of undertaking the project was to familiarise ourselves with C# development, we ended up learning a lot about technical debt and refactoring. worked as a developer in a small team and found a lot of fun challenges in this problem space.
