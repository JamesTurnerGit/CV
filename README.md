I'm a full-Stack multi-language developer. Problem-solving is my natural state. I’m never happier than when I have a fresh challenge to tackle. My current goal is changing my career so I can satisfy my desire to continuously work on new problems.

## <a name="projects">Projects & Code</a>
Some of my more current or favourite projects that I particularly enjoyed Working on.
### AtomicWars - [Atom.io](https://atom.io/packages/atomic-wars) - [GitHub](https://github.com/JamesTurnerGit/Atomic-Wars)
A plugin for Atom that Interfaces with the CodeWars.com API to pull down kata for you to solve and displays them in Atom so you can complete them in your preferred environment. This app also uploads your completed kata up to GitHub when you’ve submitted them.
### Thunder Warriors - [Web Demo](http://thunder-warriors.herokuapp.com/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/treborb/thunder-warriors)
A tower defence game built in unity. While the main goal of undertaking the project was to familiarise myself with C# development, we ended up learning a lot more about code debt and refactoring. Halfway through we decided we’d rather start almost from scratch rather than keep the patterns we’d used while trying to get something working. It ended up being my favourite project during makers by far and something i'm continuing to develop post-makers by continuing to refactor and add multiplayer.
### FaceBookSpinnerApp [GitHub](https://github.com/JamesTurnerGit/FaceBookSpinner)
Very simple app to take a list of names from facebook and parse it into a randomizer for contests, displays results graphically, still in progress.

## <a name="experience">Experience</a> 

### NM group 2012-2016 

Responsible for processing large point clouds gathered from LiDAR scanners into accurate computer simulations of overhead powerlines and other utilities. During my time here my love for coding and puzzle solving was reignited. 

The key moment of this was during a job surveying Britain’s railways where we had a systematic issue with our ground model. Normally we’d have to do rework from scratch to solve this and that’d cost several thousand pounds in man-hours alone. On my own initiative, I wrote a script that was able to find and correct the issues without damaging the rest of the data. From then on the script was used regularly throughout the day by our processors. 

Solved a lot of additional problems in production by continuing to write scripts in python and MicroStation Basic.

Worked effectively on a small team to hit deadlines consistently.

### Energy bar 2008 - 2009 

Waiter and cook, also responsible for locking up and opening shop. Frequently was the sole operator at our busy shop. Strengthened Time management and prioritisation skills.  

### Harrogate Hospital 2007-2008 

Helped people find their way around the hospital, helped wheelchair bound people move around the building, ran samples from the front desk to the labs. 

### Phase 4 Computers 2006-2007 

Responsible for repairing machines hardware and software. This job appealed directly to my love of puzzle solving. Each machine was a new puzzle for me to sink my teeth into. Worked to tight deadlines and limited resources.

### Makers Academy

Built upon my foundation of learning by studying new concepts like TDD, SOLID, MVC and more. Changed my patterns of thinking about programming to result in writing much neater code than before I started.

### 2 years at Bradford University

Studied Cybernetics and virtual worlds - this included subjects like Human interface design, Robotics and Programming. Programming specifically involved basic neural networks and other control systems as well as basic OOD.
