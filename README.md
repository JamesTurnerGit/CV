I'm a full-Stack multi-language developer with two years experience. Problem-solving is my natural state and I work well in agile teams. I’m never happier than when I have a fresh challenge to tackle and something new to learn. I'm always looking for new challenges and ways to test and improve myself.

### LexisNexis-Enterprise Solutions
#### Software Engineer Apr 2018 — present
Developed a PWA app that runs off a microservices based backend that integrates with dynamics 365. App synchronises accross multible devices and runs on any modern device and is offline-first.

Helped run and organise a blockchain hackathon. Was involved from the very initial planning stages to the latenight cleanup. Event concluded very successfully and was a lot of fun.

Helped teams transition from a scrum methodology to a Kanban approach.
#### QA engineer Oct 2017 — Apr 2018 
Wrote several frameworks from scratch, including a piece that was able to do frontend and interaction testing on powerbi, and one that was able to parse report outputs in a convienent and straightforward way.

Worked on the testing project for the main product, renovating and refatoring large sections and improving performance and ease of use while driving upskilling for the QA team. 

Ran large scale SAT's on the companies main product and wrote up documention and procedures surrounding it

### Makers Academy
Built upon my foundation of learning by studying new concepts like TDD, SOLID, MVC and more. Changed my patterns of thinking about programming to result in writing much neater code than before I started.

### NM group 2012-2016 

Responsible for processing large point clouds gathered from LiDAR scanners into accurate computer simulations of overhead powerlines and other utilities. During my time here my love for coding and puzzle solving was reignited. 

The key moment of this was during a job surveying Britain’s railways where we had a systematic issue with our ground model. Normally we’d have to do rework from scratch to solve this and that’d cost several thousand pounds in man-hours alone. On my own initiative, I wrote a script that was able to find and correct the issues without damaging the rest of the data. From then on the script was used regularly throughout the day by our processors. 

Solved a lot of additional problems in production by continuing to write scripts in python and MicroStation Basic.

Worked effectively on a small team to hit deadlines consistently.

### DCDC - [blog](https://blog.dcdc.io/)
A upcoming fork of neo based around Securely proving identity and personal details without revealing any more than you have to, and being able to do so digitally and remotely via simple methods. Leverages blockchain technology to produce complete end-to-end security.
### AtomicWars - [Atom.io](https://atom.io/packages/atomic-wars) - [GitHub](https://github.com/JamesTurnerGit/Atomic-Wars)
A plugin for Atom that Interfaces with the CodeWars.com API to pull down kata for you to solve and displays them in Atom so you can complete them in your preferred environment. This app also uploads your completed kata up to GitHub when you’ve submitted them.
### Thunder Warriors - [Web Demo](http://thunder-warriors.herokuapp.com/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/treborb/thunder-warriors)
A tower defence game built in unity. While the main goal of undertaking the project was to familiarise myself with C# development, we ended up learning a lot more about code debt and refactoring. Halfway through we decided we’d rather start almost from scratch rather than keep the patterns we’d used while trying to get something working. It ended up being my favourite project I worked on during makers by a long way.
